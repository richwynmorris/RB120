## What is object orientated programming? 
OOP takes a different approach to procedural programming, which can become reliant on a high number of dependencies. OOP uses the 3 principles of inheritence, polymorphism and encapsualtion to create an object based system, where objects are independent of one another and are responsible for their own behaviours and data. This allows us to build programs with greater levels of abstraction and complexity through object interactions. This also allows us to implement principles like DRY to avoid duplication in our code and extract logic to specific objects.
