### RB129 Interview Assessment 

The interview assessment revolves around explaining concepts verbally and providing examples to support your explanation and understanding of the concept.

You will also be given code problems that the interviewer will give you and will need to solve them and explain your reasoning and decisions.

You should have a strong conceptual knowledge of the OOP principles, why they exist and how to use them. 

You will need to speak throughout the assessment, so you need to practise verbalising your explanations and speaking them aloud and from memory. (Anki should help with this.)

Next steps:
- Revise through the OOP and add questions to ANKI deck as you reread. 
- Revise the written part of the assessment and write out examples for each of the concepts.
- Revise modules indepth and practise using them in a more complex way. 
- Organise 6 study sessions purely based on verbal communication.
- Assessment should take around 25 minutes.
